# PWA Setup Guide - Install on iPhone

Your dashboard is now a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can be installed on your iPhone like a native app!

## Step 1: Generate App Icons

Before deploying, you need to create the app icons:

1. Open `web/public/generate-icons.html` in your browser
2. Click "Download 192x192" and save as `icon-192.png`
3. Click "Download 512x512" and save as `icon-512.png`
4. Move both PNG files to `web/public/` folder

## Step 2: Build and Deploy

```bash
cd web
npm run build
```

Then push to GitHub and deploy to Railway.

## Step 3: Install on iPhone

1. **Open Safari** on your iPhone (must use Safari, not Chrome)
2. **Navigate to your Railway URL** (e.g., https://your-app.up.railway.app)
3. **Tap the Share button** (square with arrow pointing up at bottom of screen)
4. **Scroll down** and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
5. **Edit the name** if you want (default: "Logs & Stats")
6. **Tap "Add"** in the top right
